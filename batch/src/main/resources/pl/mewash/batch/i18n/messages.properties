tooltip.download.file_only_radio=Saves only media (audio/video) file.

label.download.file_with_desc_radio=Media with description
tooltip.download.file_with_desc_radio=Creates a title dir with: media & description files inside.

label.download.file_with_metadata_radio=Media with description and metadata
tooltip.download.file_with_metadata_radio=Creates a title dir with: media, description & info.json files inside.

# Grouping mode
label.grouping_selection=Grouping mode:

label.grouping.no_grouping=No grouping
tooltip.grouping.no_grouping=Saves all files in same place.

label.grouping.by_content=Group by content
tooltip.grouping.by_content=Groups given content files in dir with all selected formats inside.

label.grouping.by_format=Group by format
tooltip.grouping.by_format=Groups all contents in given formats in separate format dirs.

# Date dir
label.add_date_checkbox=Add download date dir
tooltip.add_date_checkbox=Inserts dir with date of download in place dependent on grouping mode

# Multithreading
label.multithreadingSelection=Multithreading level:

tooltip.multithreading.warning=Multithreading can do huge process speed up, but will consume much more computer resources. Application reserves 4 threads for smooth experience and responsiveness.\n\
  Rest of available cores depending on selected multithreading option will be used to process downloads in parallel which can significantly speed up work.\n\
  Computers with more than 8 logical processors guarantee at least unused thread to keep OS responsive.\n\
  Computers with 8 or fewer threads does not guarantee that, so select multithreading with cautious as it can lead to loss of system responsiveness and impact performance\n\
  Generally multithreading is not recommended for computers with 6 or fewer threads until you are aware of possible freezes and really need to get work done ASAP.

# Single
label.multithreading.single.prefix=Single
label.multithreading.single.suffix=- No multithreading (single worker tread)
tooltip.multithreading.single=Processes tasks sequentially (one by one) with single thread.\n\
  Safest for weak CPUs or when running in background with minimal resource usage.

# Low
label.multithreading.low.prefix=Low
label.multithreading.low.suffix=- At least 2 worker threads (~30% CPU usage)
tooltip.multithreading.low=Reserves 2 and uses 1/4 of remaining threads as workers.\n\
  Keeps system responsive while speeding things up slightly.

# Medium
label.multithreading.medium.prefix=Medium
label.multithreading.medium.suffix=- At least 3 worker threads (~60% CPU usage)
tooltip.multithreading.medium=Reserves 2 and uses 1/2 of remaining threads as workers.\n\
  Ideal for fastest downloads and possibility to still use computer for not exhaustive tasks,

# Maximum
label.multithreading.maximum.prefix=Maximum
label.multithreading.maximum.suffix=- At least 4 worker threads (~95% CPU usage)
tooltip.multithreading.maximum=Reserves 2 and uses all remaining threads as workers\n\
  Tries to leave leave one spare thread for OS, but it's not guaranteed with 8 or less logical cores machines.\n\
  Maximum speed, but not recommended if you need to use computer for anything else in the meantime.
