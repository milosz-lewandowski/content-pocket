label.paste_urls=Paste URLs:
tooltip.paste_url=Links must be separated by a space, newline, comma, or semicolon. You can also paste them in any format, with titles, descriptions, or extra text. We wash and extract only the clean URLs.

label.save_to_dir=Save to:
button.browse_dirs=Browse...

menu.advanced_options=Advanced Options

label.download_type=Download mode:

label.download.file_only_radio.prefix=Media file only
label.download.file_only_radio.suffix=-> downloads the file in the selected format (perfect for casual use)
tooltip.download.file_only_radio=Saves only the audio/video file (.mp3, .wav, .mp4) without metadata

label.download.file_with_metadata_radio.prefix=Media file with metadata files (description & info.json)
label.download.file_with_metadata_radio.suffix=-> saves the file with metadata files in a folder (great for archiving or building a media library)
tooltip.download.file_with_metadata_radio=Creates a folder named after the title and places the file, description, and JSON metadata inside

label.grouping_selection=Grouping mode:

label.grouping.no_grouping.prefix=No grouping
label.grouping.no_grouping.suffix=-> All content files in one place (ideal for quick downloads)
tooltip.grouping.no_grouping=Saves all files in the same folder or side-by-side

label.grouping.by_content.prefix=Group by content
label.grouping.by_content.suffix=-> Content in all formats in one folder (ideal for getting audio and video of the same content together)
tooltip.grouping.by_content=All formats of a given title are stored in a single folder named after that title

label.grouping.by_format.prefix=Group by format
label.grouping.by_format.suffix=-> All contents of each format in separate folders. e.g. all MP3, and all  MP4 grouped (ideal for large organized archives)
tooltip.grouping.by_format=Creates separate MP3 / WAV / MP4 folders for the corresponding files

label.add_date_checkbox.prefix=Add date folder
label.add_date_checkbox.suffix=-> Separate folder for downloads from each day
tooltip.add_date_checkbox=Creates a date-based folder depending on the grouping. For format grouping: /format/date/. For others: /date/...

label.multithreadingSelection=Multithreading level:

tooltip.multithreading.warning=Multithreading can do huge process speed up, but will consume much more computer resources. Application reserves 4 threads for smooth experience and responsiveness. \
  Rest of available cores depending on selected multithreading option will be used to process downloads in parallel which can significantly speed up work. \
  Computers with more than 8 logical processors guarantee at least unused thread to keep OS responsive. \
  Computers with 8 or fewer threads does not guarantee that, so select multithreading with cautious as it can lead to loss of system responsiveness and impact performance\
  Generally multithreading is not recommended for computers with 6 or fewer threads until you are aware of possible freezes and really need to get work done ASAP.
# SINGLE
label.multithreading.single.prefix=Single thread
label.multithreading.single.suffix=-> No multithreading (Ideal for background downloads with minimall effect on system)
tooltip.multithreading.single=Processes one task at a time with single thread. Safest for weak CPUs or when running in background with minimal resource usage.
# LOW
label.multithreading.low.prefix=Low
label.multithreading.low.suffix=-> At least 2 threads (~30% CPU usage). Balanced performance and stability recommended for most cases
tooltip.multithreading.low=Uses 4 reserved + 1/4 of remaining non-reserved threads. Keeps UI responsive while speeding things up slightly.
# MEDIUM
label.multithreading.medium.prefix=Medium
label.multithreading.medium.suffix=-> At least 3 threads (~60% CPU usage). Ideal for fastest downloads and possibility to still work on computer
tooltip.multithreading.medium=Uses 4 reserved + half of remaining non-reserved threads. A good compromise between performance and system responsiveness.
# MAXIMUM
label.multithreading.maximum.prefix=Maximum
label.multithreading.maximum.suffix=-> At least 4 threads (~95% CPU usage). Maximum speed, but not recommended if you need to use computer for anything else in the meantime.
tooltip.multithreading.maximum=Uses 4 reserved + all of remaining non-reserved threads (leaves one spare thread for OS, but not guaranteed in computers with 8 or less logical cores.)\
  Aggressively uses most CPU threads for maximum download speed. Best for short or urgent jobs.
