macOS release is a .dmg application image.
this application works on the top of ffmpeg, ffprobe and yt-dlp, however these binaries are not bundled inside dmg image.
This application after startup will search for binaries presence under:
 - under default location (~/bin/'here') with execute privileges (recommended)
 - if are added to system $path variable
 - if not found app will ask user to specify path to directory with these binaries. (not recommended because of macOS
   restrictive access policy)
