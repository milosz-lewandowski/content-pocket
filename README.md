No clickbaits. No feeds. No shorts. No distractions.

ContentPocket is a cross-platform Java desktop application designed for checking and watching latest content with chosen format in distraction-free mode.

**Subscriptions tab:** Add your trusted channels or content providers, fetch titles progressively from latest and decide what to play as audio, video, or both (with per-channel format and quality preferences).

**Batch tab:** Reach your meaningful or favourite content in a format you need. Paste links, choose fitting formats, group them flexibly and control your system load with adjustable multithreading.

This is a PET (Personal Educational/Training) project, created for learning and experimentation.
It is not intended for commercial use or production deployment.

## üì∏ UI preview (screenshots)

### Subscriptions Tab
- **Browse & Manage Filtered Content**  
  Add channels, fetch latest, browse content, play videos or audios. Only sources you trust, no distractors.  
  ![Subscriptions view with expanded Java channel](docs/screenshots/demo_subs_view_contents.png)

- **Per-channel Settings**  
  Configure default formats, additional files, and auto-fetch latest on startup or progressively on demand.

## üì• Installation

### ü™ü Windows - "Plug & Play" - Portable ZIP (tools bundled)
This distribution already includes the required executables (`ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `yt-dlp`).  
No setup needed:

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract files.
3. Run `ContentPocket.exe`.

That‚Äôs all.

---

### ü™ü Windows - Lightweight ZIP (tools not bundled)
If you already have `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `yt-dlp` installed (either in a folder or on your system/user PATH), you can use lightweight (without tools execs inside) distribution.

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract files.
3. Run `ContentPocket.exe`.

The app will:
- First check whether required binaries are available via `PATH`.
- If not found, App will ask you to provide a directory with tools execs.

**Requirement:** all tools executables must be placed in the same directory.

That's all.

---

### üçè macOS - DMG image (tools not bundled)
As Apple Inc. does not try to make developer's life easier (unless you pay 100$/y),
required tools binaries could not be easily bundled, and installing this App on macOS needs some more hustle.

1. Install `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `yt-dlp_macos`.

The app will look for them:
- On your user/system `PATH`.
- In `~/bin/`.
- If not found, App will ask you to provide a directory with tools binaries.

**Requirement:** all tools must be placed in the same directory.

2. Make sure the binaries have required permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 755 ffmpeg ffprobe yt-dlp_macos
   ```
- Or setup more restrictive custom permissions with at least: `yt-dlp_macos`: rwx, `ffmpeg`: rwx, `ffprobe`: rx

3. Allow the app from 'Unknown Developer' in macOS Security & Privacy settings:
   [Apple Support Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac)


4. If App still have problem  still fails, run the app from Terminal:
   ```bash
   /Applications/ContentPocket.app/Contents/MacOS/ContentPocket
   ```

Good luck.

## ‚òï Codebase Overview

ContentPocket consists of **5 highly independent, decoupled modules**.  
The project is written in pure Java & JavaFX, with no external frameworks. 
Uses Jackson for json files storage, and compile time, static Lombok dependencies.     

---

### üìñ Commands-API (standalone library)

This module acts as a **pure Java library** for building yt-dlp + ffmpeg processes.  
In the future it may be published as a standalone repository.

- **Exports APIs**
    - `ProcessFactory` ‚Äî abstraction for building ready-to-run processes:
        - Reach audio-only stream
        - Reach audio+video stream
        - Fetch channel data or content list with selected output params
    - `CmdBuilder` ‚Äî abstraction for building structured multi-parameter commands, easy to extend for custom `ProcessFactory` implementations.

- **Exports settings**
    - `DownloadOption`
        - `AudioOption` ‚Üí used in `ProcessFactory.audioStream()`
            - Default impl: `AudioOnlyQuality` with MP3, high-bitrate M4A, low-size M4A, WAV (converted from lossy), and *source codec* (best available without lossy conversion).
        - `VideoOption` ‚Üí used in `ProcessFactory.videoWithAudioStream()`
            - Default impl: `VideoQuality` with 720p ‚Üí 4K MP4 resolutions, H.264 + AAC enforced at 720p/1080p, flexible at higher resolutions with fallbacks.
    - `StorageOptions` ‚Äî defines grouping modes, content description, `info.json` inclusion, today's date, etc.
    - `DlpCmd` ‚Äî interface with `FetchCmd` & `DownloadCmd` implementations, bundling useful yt-dlp command sets.

- **ProcessFactory usage**
    - Requires paths to `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` executables.
    - Accepts a text output file (stable UTF-8 platform-independent results).
    - Parameters: chosen download options + storage options.

- **Current heuristics**
    - Implements sensible fallbacks for stream codec selection.
    - Optimizes ffmpeg post-processing when needed.

- **Future extensions**
    - Fetch full codec lists and auto-select best target codec.
    - Conditional post-processing via ffprobe checks.

### üì¶ Batch Module (pluggable tab)

- Requires: `commands-api`, `common`.
- Provides: `BatchTabPlugin` (via pluggable `TabPlugin` SPI).
- Opens: JavaFX UI elements and controllers.

**Functionality**
- Paste hundreds of content URLs.
- Reach streams with selected options, and formats.
- Grouping modes:
    - *By Content* ‚Üí all formats of a content grouped together.
    - *By Format* ‚Üí all contents in given codec/format grouped together.
- Adjustable multithreading level, backed by a platform thread pool.
- Custom queue + dispatcher:
    - Graceful stop (finish current tasks, abort pending).
    - Force stop (immediate shutdown).

---

### üì∫ Subscriptions Module (pluggable tab)

- Requires: `commands-api`, `common`.
- Provides: `SubscriptionsTabPlugin` (via pluggable `TabPlugin` SPI).
- Opens: JavaFX UI elements and controllers.
- Stores: subscription data in JSON files (no DB, keeps app lightweight).

**Functionality**
- Manage content publishers (channels).
- Fetch published contents progressively (from latest backwards).
- Per-channel settings:
    - Auto-fetch latest on startup.
    - Default audio/video format settings.
- For each content:
    - **Get Audio** / **Get Video** buttons ‚Üí reach with preconfigured settings.
    - **Open** ‚Üí opens ready stream in explorer.
- Uses a **Virtual-Per-Task Executor**:
    - Lightweight async fetches & stream handling.
    - Smooth UI responsiveness.

---

### üîó Main Module (application entry point)

- Requires: `common`.
- Uses: `TabPlugin` SPI to load Batch, Subscriptions, or any other pluggable tab module.
- Requires: `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` executables.
    - Bundled with Windows ZIP distribution.
    - macOS users must install manually.

**Functionality**
- Provides the main application window.
- On startup:
    - Verifies whether executables are available at default locations.
    - If not, prompts the user to specify installation path.

*All real logic is in the `common` module ‚Äî `main` is primarily startup, validation + SPI loader.*

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Module (application core)

- Requires: `commands-api`.
- Exports APIs required by both main and tab modules:
    - `BinariesManager` ‚Äî discovers and validates yt-dlp/ffmpeg binaries.
    - `TabPlugin` SPI ‚Äî defines pluggable feature tabs.

**Role**
- Central application logic lives here.
- Shared utilities and abstractions for Batch/Subscriptions modules.
- Acts as the ‚Äúcore‚Äù runtime layer.
